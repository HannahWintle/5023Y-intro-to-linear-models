## Lesson 1 : Introduction to statistics

In today's lesson we imported Darwin maize data to learn how to calculate basic statistics. We used the kable extra functions to create a summary table of statistics. Difference statistics was introduced whereby we learned how to calculate the mean and standard deviation. From this the standard error was calculated.

In the second half of today's lesson, we learnt how to calculate the confidence intervals and how to create a scatterplot to show the height of the probability distribution. Lastly we had a go at an example of how the statistical data would be written up in a report.
