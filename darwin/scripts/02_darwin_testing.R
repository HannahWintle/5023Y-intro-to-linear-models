# T-TEST ----

#The Student's t-test uses the t-distribution, a small-sample size version of the normal distribution, where tails are fatter if the degrees of freedom are small. 
#There are two basic types of t-test which we have encountered with our linear models.
##The one sample t-test: takes the mean of a sample and compares it with the null hypothesis of zero
##The two sample t-test which compares the difference between the means of two samples against a null hypothesis of no difference between the means of the two populations.

#There is critical t the value which must be exceeded for the test to be significant (e.g. generates a P value that is less than our predefined Œ±). 
#The critical value for t is defined by the df
#When observed t > critical t the result can be declared significantly different at that threshold for Œ±

#Summary is the most common way to investigate a model result, but it is its own specific type of R object (e.g. not a dataframe or a tibble), which is why tidying the results into a dataframe like structure can be useful. 
#Using either method we can can see that they include t-tests for the coefficient, summary explicity calls them t, while tidy() refers to them generically as the 'statistic'
