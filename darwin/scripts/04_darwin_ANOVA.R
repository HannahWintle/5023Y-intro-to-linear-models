#ANOVA (analysis of variance)----

#as designs become more complicated, the number of comparisons can quickly become overwhelming, working with estimates and intervals alone can become harder
#As designs become more elaborate the number of pairwise t-tests rapidly increases, and therefore our risk of false positives (Type I errors).
#It is therefore useful to have a complementary approach that first asks if there is any support for a difference between the different means before diving into multiple comparisons
#This approach is called analysis of variance (ANOVA), and although it tends to be associated with categorical data
#ANOVA is just another type of linear model, so this approach can also be extended to included continuous variables

#our simple linear model for the maize data was:

lsmodel1 <- lm(height ~ type, data = darwin)

summary(lsmodel1)

#The general strategy of the ANOVA is to quantify the overall variability in the data set and then to divide it into the variability between and within the groups.

#The more of the variation explained by our fitted linear model, the more confident we can be that we have detected a real effect in our estimates of mean differences.
#This method of fitting a model is called ordinary least squares.

#SST = SSR + SSE

#REMEMBER

#SST = the sum of squared differences between the data points and the grand mean

#SSR = the sum of the squared differences between the grand mean and the predicted position on the linear model

#SSE = the sum of the squared differences between the predicted position and the observed position

#TWO-WAY ANOVA----

#two way ANOVA includes (as you might guess) two variables

lsmodel2 <- lm(height ~ type + as.factor(pair), data = darwin)

anova(lsmodel2)

#________________________----
#SUMMARY----
#ANOVA tables can be built for any linear model. 
#The tables partition the variance into signal(s) and noise, which can be compared using an F-test. 
#For complex analyses where many pairwise comparisons could be performed, an initial F-test can provide the initial evidence for whether there are any differences at all, reducing the risk of overtesting and the false positives that can be generated.

#We use regression for two continuous variables, ANOVA is used with one continuous variable and one categorical variable
#Usually use a boxplot or bargraph to present data
#Residuals tell you how close the data is to a normal distribution (the closer to 0, the better)

#SUMMARY OF RESULTS----
#Increasing temperatures had a clear effect on reducing the time taken for frogspawn to hatch (one-way ANOVA: F2,57 = 385.9, P < 0.001). At 13‚àòC the mean time to hatching was 26.3 days [25.8-26.8 95% CI], this reduced by an average of 5.3 days [4.57 - 6.02] at 18‚àòC and by 10.1 days [9.37 - 10.82] at 25‚àòC.
