#ANOVA (analysis of variance)----

#as designs become more complicated, the number of comparisons can quickly become overwhelming, working with estimates and intervals alone can become harder
#As designs become more elaborate the number of pairwise t-tests rapidly increases, and therefore our risk of false positives (Type I errors).
#It is therefore useful to have a complementary approach that first asks if there is any support for a difference between the different means before diving into multiple comparisons
#This approach is called analysis of variance (ANOVA), and although it tends to be associated with categorical data
#ANOVA is just another type of linear model, so this approach can also be extended to included continuous variables

#our simple linear model for the maize data was:

lsmodel1 <- lm(height ~ type, data = darwin)

summary(lsmodel1)

#The general strategy of the ANOVA is to quantify the overall variability in the data set and then to divide it into the variability between and within the groups.

#The more of the variation explained by our fitted linear model, the more confident we can be that we have detected a real effect in our estimates of mean differences.
#This method of fitting a model is called ordinary least squares.

#SST = SSR + SSE

#REMEMBER

#SST = the sum of squared differences between the data points and the grand mean

#SSR = the sum of the squared differences between the grand mean and the predicted position on the linear model

#SSE = the sum of the squared differences between the predicted position and the observed position

#TWO-WAY ANOVA----

#two way ANOVA includes two explanatory variables

lsmodel2 <- lm(height ~ type + as.factor(pair), data = darwin)
